Hi! I'm **Luís Eduardo Melonio Correia**, a Data Analyst with solid experience in **ETL processes**, **data modeling**, and **strategic data visualization**.

My professional journey began as a *Business Intelligence* intern, where I dove into the behind-the-scenes of data structuring.

- Qlik Sense  
- Power BI  
- Apache Superset  
- Tableau  

I'm proficient in languages and technologies like:

- **SQL**
- **Python (Pandas)**
- **AWS (Athena, S3, Glue)**

I use these skills to **optimize data loads** and **enhance the reliability of analytical processes**.

Throughout my career, I’ve contributed to projects across various industries and contexts, always committed to **fostering a data-driven culture** and collaborating with **cross-functional teams** — including Product, Engineering, and Design.

I’m familiar with **agile methodologies** and have worked directly on:

- A/B testing  
- Funnel analysis

- Cohort analysis  

All aimed at **continuous improvement of user experience** and **product performance**.

I'm driven by **curiosity**, a passion for **lifelong learning**, and a desire to **turn data into decisions**.
